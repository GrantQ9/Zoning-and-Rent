## Summary:
  Debate about zoning laws and housing supply has been common in America the last few years, and rent is a ubiquitous concern for many for far longer. To better understand the relationship between the two, for a variety of cities average rent (as a percentage of income) was graphed against the amount of zoning restrictions there. Additionally, cities were sorted by minimum lot size to show how that effected rent. While increased zoning does correlate with higher rent, that's not true for any individual zoning law.



**Minimum Lot Size's Effects On The Relationship Between Zoning And Rent Across Municipalities**

## Elaboration:
  Unsurprisingly, a larger zoning index is associated with spending more income on rent across all four types of minimum lot size. However, the smallest lot size is associated with a higher percentage of income spent on rent than the others, despite being the least restrictive zoning requirement of them.
