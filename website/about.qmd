This project discusses the relationship between a number of different kinds of zoning restrictions and rent payments. For access to all the data and code used in the project, see the Github page  [here](https://github.com/GrantQ9/Zoning-and-Rent).

This project was done as part of my time in [Kane's Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/).
